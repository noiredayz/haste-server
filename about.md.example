# Haste

Sharing code is a good thing, and it should be _really_ easy to do.
A lot of times, I want to show you something I'm seeing - and that's where we
use pastebins.

Haste is the prettiest, easiest to use pastebin ever made.

## Basic Usage

Paste your code, click "Save" and copy the URL.
Send that URL to someone and they'll see your code.

To make a new entry, click "New" (or hit `Ctrl + N`)

## From the Console

Sometimes I want to show you some text from my current console session.  
We made it really easy to take code from the console and send it to people.

`cat something | haste` # https://hastebin.com/2107420

You can take this a step further and directly copy the URL with:

* osx: `cat something | haste | pbcopy`
* linux: `cat something | haste | xsel`
* windows: check out [WinHaste](https://github.com/ajryan/WinHaste)

After running that, URL to your paste will be copied to clipboard.

That's all there is to that, and you can install it with `gem install haste`
right now.
  * osx: you will need to have an up to date version of Xcode
  * linux: you will need to have rubygems and ruby-devel installed

## Duration

The operator of each hastebin instance decides how long they wish to store pastes. 
The default is to keep them indefinitely.

## Privacy

Post things at your own risk. Not responsible for any removed pastes. Contact the operator
of the server in question about privacy concerns, terms of use, acceptable use, GDPR etc.

## Free Software

Haste can easily be installed behind your network, and it's all free (as in freedom)!
